# test-task-samba.sh - unit tests for tasks/samba.sh: the smb.conf section,
# the compose file's quoting, the native path's password order, and with
# SAMBA_DOCKER=yes that a generated password is printed and saved before the
# container starts, so a failed first start (after which later runs read it
# from /opt/samba/password) does not lose it. Docker, Samba's tools, ports and
# save_secret are stubbed; nothing outside a temp folder changes. The
# container password case is skipped if this machine has a saved password.
