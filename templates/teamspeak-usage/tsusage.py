"""Log who is online on the TeamSpeak server, and when (tasks/teamspeak.sh).

Runs in the teamspeak-usage container next to the server. It logs in to the
server's SSH query as serveradmin (query clients are hidden from users),
reads who is online, registers for join and leave events and writes, in
$USAGE_DATA (default /data):

  sessions.jsonl  one line per finished visit: uid, nick, start, end (epoch),
                  the names of the client's server groups, its platform,
                  when it first connected and the IP address it came from
  online.json     who is online now (with their IP addresses), and when that
                  was last confirmed
  stats.json      minutes spent per channel per day (last 7 days)
  usage.json      the summary the start page shows (copied there by the web
                  task's rpi-setup-web-links timer); it never holds an IP

The data folder is 0700 and the two files with addresses 0600: the bot's
user and root read them, nobody else on the Pi.

Once a minute it also reads the server info, the channels and the details of
each client online (channel, client version and platform, country, away and
muted state, idle time) for the page's TeamSpeak tab, and every 30 minutes
the address people on the internet connect to: $TS_PUBLIC_ADDRESS (a DynDNS
name, or a fixed IPv4 or IPv6 address shown as it is) and the IPv4 address
the name resolves to (its IPv6 address when it has no IPv4 one), or, when
that is empty, the public IPv4 address a "what is my IP" service
($TS_PUBLIC_IP_URLS) sees the Pi connect from. TS_PUBLIC_ADDRESS=no shows
none and looks up nothing.

Visits older than $USAGE_DAYS days are dropped. When the connection or the
bot stops, the people online stay recorded; on the next connect the ones still
there keep their start time and the others' visits end at the last check.

Run with --summary to print usage.json from the files without connecting.
